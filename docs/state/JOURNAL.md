## YYYY-MM-DD — <session title> (<branch or PR>)
**Did:**       what changed, concretely
**Why:**       the reason, citing [P§n] or ADR-XXXX
**Broke:**     what went wrong, including dead ends — record these, they are the
               most valuable lines in this file
**Learned:**   what a future session should know
**Left open:** what was deliberately not done
```

## 2026-08-30 — Governance scaffold (docs bootstrap)

**Did:** Froze the project definition as `docs/PROJECT.md` (§1–§35, verbatim). Created
`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, architecture overview with the responsibility table, ADR
template, seed ADR-0001 (capability model), roadmap, rolling state files, and the
approvals / research / evaluation / data contracts.

**Why:** `[P§35]` — the canonical document must be turned into operational repository
files without losing or contradicting any of it. The `[P§__]` citation convention exists
so drift from canon is greppable rather than a matter of opinion.

**Broke:** Nothing yet — no code touched.

**Learned:** The document's own §29 principles and §34 boundary test are strong enough to
serve directly as machine-enforceable rules; they were lifted into `CLAUDE.md` rather
than paraphrased.

**Left open:** Every ADR except the seed. GitHub scaffolding. Answers to Q1–Q5 in
`OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

## 2026-09-01 — Documentation + capability-state correction pass

**Did:** Full documentation consistency audit, then corrected everything it found.
(1) Retired `spec/00-vision.md`, `01-principles.md`, `02-architecture.md` (fully
duplicated `docs/PROJECT.md` or conflicted with ADR-governed `docs/architecture/
OVERVIEW.md`) and `07-human-approval-and-safety.md`, `09-artifact-and-experiment-
contracts.md` (conflicted with `docs/APPROVALS.md` / `docs/state/EXPERIMENTS.md`;
unique content merged in first). Reduced `spec/03-agent-runtime.md` and `spec/05-
cv-engineering-lifecycle.md` to technical elaborations that cite the canon instead of
restating it, with explicit "not implemented yet" headers.
(2) Rewrote `docs/development/GITHUB_FLOW_V1.md` and `GITHUB_DEVELOPMENT_MODEL.md`:
retired the two-trunk `main`/`dev-munna` model with its two-stage PM approval gate
(neither is how the project actually works); replaced with single trunk `main` +
`feature/<owner>/<work>` branches, PR reviewed and merged by the project owner.
Updated `CLAUDE.md` §6 and `AGENTS.md`'s Workflow section to match.
(3) Added `spec/` and `docs/development/` to README's document map and a pointer
(not a bulk-read requirement) in `CLAUDE.md` §2, since neither tree was discoverable
from any prescribed entry point before this.
(4) Capability registry semantics: found `spec/capability_registry.json` marked
every capability `status: "available"`/`"partial"` (20 entries, after a concurrent
session's additions) with zero executable skill/tool bindings anywhere in
`cv_agent/`, and `CapabilityRegistry.check_item()` hardcoded `available: True`
unconditionally. Introduced `status: "planned"` (declared, no executable binding),
tightened `"available"` to require a verified executable binding, set all 20
capabilities to `"planned"`, and made `check_item()` report `executable: False` with
a reason. `select()`/`Capability.is_available` now require `status == "available"`
strictly (previously counted `"partial"` too). Logged as an interim correction in
ADR-0001 §8a — does not implement the ADR's `Resolution`/`resolve()` design.

**Why:** `[P§35]`, `[P§23]`, ADR-0001 §3 ("known but unavailable" as a first-class
state) — a registry that claims a capability is usable when nothing can invoke it is
a false claim, not a documentation nitpick. The git-workflow and spec-duplication
fixes were explicit user corrections to what this repo's process and canon actually
are, not architectural choices of my own.

**Broke:** Found and fixed two unrelated concurrency-introduced bugs while verifying:
`cv_agent/capabilities/registry.py` and `cv_agent/config/settings.py` imported
`importlib.resources.abc.Traversable`, which doesn't exist before Python 3.12 (this
repo targets 3.10+) — added a fallback to `importlib.abc.Traversable`. Also found
`cv_agent/config/settings.py` referenced an undefined `_REPO_ROOT` name in dead code
(`_default_config_path`/`_default_registry_path`, unused elsewhere) — defined it.
Also found `cv_agent/resources/spec/capability_registry.json` (the packaged runtime
copy) had drifted from `spec/capability_registry.json` (the source of truth) — still
9 stale `"available"` entries after the source had grown to 20 `"planned"` ones, so
the actual running CLI was reporting the old, wrong data. Synced it and added
`tests/test_package_resources.py::test_packaged_registry_matches_source_of_truth`
so this can't silently drift again.

**Learned:** Multiple files in this repo (`spec/00-11`, `docs/development/*`,
`cv_agent/capabilities/registry.py`) were edited concurrently by another session
while this pass was running — several `Read`-then-`Edit` calls failed with
"file modified since read" and had to be re-read. Don't trust a file's content from
earlier in a long session without re-reading it immediately before editing,
especially anything under active multi-session development.

**Left open:** `docs/development/GITHUB_FLOW_V1.md` and `GITHUB_DEVELOPMENT_MODEL.md`
still duplicate each other substantially (by design — one is the procedural
reference, one the executive summary — but they should be watched for drift the same
way the capability registry copies were). Q1–Q5 in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` remain
unanswered and still block ADR-0003. No commit or push was made — see git status.

## 2026-09-01 — Phase 1 state reconciliation (docs/reconcile-dev-munna-phase1-state)

**Did:** Reconciled the project state onto the agreed `main` → `dev-munna` → short-lived
branch workflow; restored the Phase 1 status, restored ADR-0002 as a draft, recorded the
Q7/Q8 decisions as D-016/D-017, and added the current `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.

**Why:** The active `dev-munna` state had reverted to Phase 0 wording and still described
the retired single-trunk workflow, while the project is continuing Phase 1 architecture
work. The repository state must describe the actual operating model before more ADR work
proceeds.

**Broke:** The existing `DECISIONS.md` update repeatedly returned a GitHub contents API
409 despite the blob SHA matching the fetched file. No overwrite or force update was made
to that file through the API; its existing content therefore remains unchanged on this
branch until it can be updated safely.

**Learned:** The prior ADR-0002 draft still exists on the historical short-lived branch
`docs/issue-11-adr-0002-llm-gateway` and can be recovered without reconstructing it from
memory.

**Left open:** `DECISIONS.md` still needs D-008 marked superseded and D-015–D-018 appended.
Q1–Q5 remain unanswered and therefore continue to block the dependent ADRs.

## 2026-09-01 — ADR-0003 Orchestration State & Checkpointing (docs/issue-adr-0003-orchestration-state)

**Did:** Drafted `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-0003-orchestration-state.md` specifying the
LangGraph orchestration state machine, typed `AgentState` schema, local SQLite checkpointer
backed persistence at `.cv_agent/state/checkpoints.sqlite` (Q1 / D-013, Q8 / D-018),
persistent human approval interrupt/resume mechanics surviving process restarts (Q3 / D-015,
`[P§24]`), and out-of-process asynchronous external job handles (Q2 / D-014). Updated
`STATUS.md`, `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, and appended `D-017`, `D-018`, `D-019` to `DECISIONS.md`.

**Why:** `[P§21]`, `[P§24]`, `[P§25]`, `[P§34]` — the orchestration layer must own workflow
transitions, persistent checkpoints, approval gates, and error recovery contracts without
leaking domain reasoning, LLM provider specifics, or tool execution into the graph.

**Broke:** Nothing broken. Running tests and static analysis passed.

**Learned:** Scoping checkpoints to local workspace SQLite satisfies both Q1 (per-project
isolation) and Q3 (cross-process restart survival) cleanly without external network services.

**Left open:** ADR-0003 revised with dual-SQLite reconciliation and full acceptance criteria, awaiting PM review/acceptance. ADR-0004 (project memory / experiment ledger) is unblocked for drafting. Q5 remains deferred.

## 2026-09-03 — ADR-0005 Tools and MCP Execution Boundary Accepted (dev-munna)

**Did:** Formally accepted `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-0005-tools-and-mcp-boundary.md` (`D-023`). Established the execution boundary: typed `ToolDescriptor` interfaces decoupled from physical transport; execution target abstraction (`LOCAL`, `REMOTE`, `MCP_ENDPOINT`); operational discovery subordinated to ADR-0001's authoritative `ToolId` registry; structured argument vector invocation prohibiting raw shell strings; approval precondition verification per `docs/APPROVALS.md`; and type-safe asynchronous execution handoff via `ActiveJobHandoff` mechanically aligned with ADR-0003's `ActiveJobRef`. Updated `DECISIONS.md`, `STATUS.md`, and `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.

**Why:** `[P§10]`, `[P§15]`, `[P§22]`, `[P§23]`, `[P§24]`, `[P§29.4]`, `[P§34]` — isolates execution adapters from reasoning, skills, and graph orchestration. Enforces the Apple Silicon / macOS reality (`D-022`) where local execution lacks NVIDIA runtimes, preventing invalid host execution assumptions while providing a uniform interface for future remote GPU targets (`D-014`) and MCP servers.

**Broke:** Nothing broken. Architecture and documentation changes only; no runtime implementation code modified.

**Learned:** Subordinating MCP tool discovery to ADR-0001's authoritative `ToolId` catalogue prevents external tool endpoints from silently mutating or expanding the agent's capability surface without governance.

**Left open:** ADR-0006 (Knowledge / RAG) is the next architectural specification, under the roadmap's Phase 2 — Knowledge & Research sequence. Q10 remains open and continues to block ADR-0009 (Dataset subsystem).

---

## 2026-09-03 — ADR-0006 Knowledge & RAG Architecture Drafting (docs/issue-adr-0006-knowledge-rag)

**Did:** Created task branch `docs/issue-adr-0006-knowledge-rag` from `dev-munna`. Drafted `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-0006-knowledge-and-rag.md` in `Status: Proposed`. Established the Knowledge & RAG boundary: dual knowledge mechanisms (persistent knowledge vs. live research per `[P§16]`); 8-tier evidence weighting hierarchy (`[P§17]`); LinkedIn as signal-only (`[P§17]`); mandatory provenance and un-dated document rejection (`[P§18]`); topic-domain freshness horizons with temporal decay (`[P§18]`); workspace-isolated hybrid dense/lexical indexing under `.cv_agent/knowledge/` (`D-013`); strict separation from Project Memory (`ADR-0004`) and LLM Gateway (`ADR-0002`); and proposed Phase 2 interface contracts (`KnowledgeIngester`, `KnowledgeRetriever`). Updated `STATUS.md` and `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.

**Why:** `[P§16]`, `[P§17]`, `[P§18]`, `[P§19]`, `[P§29.3]`, `[P§29.7]`, `[P§34]` — the CV Engineering Agent requires current ecosystem knowledge without falling victim to hallucinations, promotional marketing claims, or ungrounded retrieval volume.

**Broke:** Nothing broken. Architecture and specification contracts only; no runtime implementation code modified.

**Learned:** Explicitly decoupling external general CV engineering knowledge (`ADR-0006`) from internal project-specific memory and experimental baselines (`ADR-0004`) prevents knowledge drift and preserves reproducible measurement integrity.

**Left open:** ADR-0006 specification drafted in `Proposed` status, awaiting architectural review. Q10 remains open and continues to block ADR-0009 (Dataset subsystem).

---

## 2026-09-03 — ADR-0006 Knowledge & RAG Subsystem Formally Accepted (dev-munna)

**Did:** Formally accepted `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-0006-knowledge-and-rag.md` as the authoritative decision (`D-024`) following PR #20 and PR #21 merge into `dev-munna`. Settled the Knowledge architecture: dual knowledge mechanisms (persistent knowledge vs. live research); Research Engine (Roadmap 05) as active investigator vs. Knowledge Subsystem (Roadmap 04) as passive evidence substrate; 8-tier evidence hierarchy with LinkedIn as discovery signal only (weight <= 0.2); mandatory provenance invariant requiring canonical URI, origin anchor (Git SHA, content SHA-256, or ETag), author/org, date, and source class; domain freshness horizons with linear decay and volatile domain expiration suppression; normalized hybrid scoring (S_dense and S_sparse normalized to [0, 1] before fusion 0.65 S_dense + 0.35 S_sparse); single-project workspace containment at `.cv_agent/knowledge/` (`D-013`); strict boundary decoupling from Project Memory (`ADR-0004`) and LLM Gateway (`ADR-0002`, dynamic vector dimensionality); and prompt-injection defense establishing the architectural data/instruction boundary with zero execution authority. Recorded `D-024` in `DECISIONS.md`; synchronized `STATUS.md`, `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, and `JOURNAL.md`.

**Why:** `[P§16]`, `[P§17]`, `[P§18]`, `[P§19]`, `[P§20]`, `[P§29.3]`, `[P§29.7]`, `[P§34]` — establishes settled architectural specification for Phase 2 Knowledge & RAG prior to Phase 3 Skills architecture.

**Broke:** Nothing broken. Governance and state synchronization only; no runtime implementation code modified.

**Learned:** Explicit normalization of dense and lexical scores is required prior to linear fusion to guarantee mathematically sound, deterministic retrieval ranking across disparate metric scales. Enforcing data/instruction boundaries as the primary security control protects agent reasoning without altering or censoring evidential source text.

**Left open:** ADR-0007 (Skills Architecture & NVIDIA Discovery) is the next architectural specification. Q10 remains open and continues to block ADR-0009 (Dataset subsystem).

---

## 2026-09-03 — ADR-0007 Skills Architecture & NVIDIA Discovery Drafting (docs/issue-adr-0007-skills)

**Did:** Created task branch `docs/issue-adr-0007-skills` from `dev-munna` to implement Issue #22. Drafted `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-0007-skills-architecture.md` in `Status: Proposed`. Established the Skills architecture: declarative `SkillDescriptor` contracts decoupled from tool execution; `CapabilityId → SkillId → ToolId` resolution hierarchy preserving ADR-0001 registry authority; typed skill availability state machine (`KNOWN`, `DISCOVERED`, `CONFIGURED`, `AVAILABLE`, `EXECUTABLE`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `KNOWN_BUT_UNAVAILABLE`); declarative NVIDIA ecosystem adapters (TensorRT, Model Optimizer PTQ/QAT, TAO, DeepStream, DALI, Triton, Jetson, CUDA Agent) per `[P§15]`; the known-but-unavailable constraint enforcing zero silent CPU fallback on unconfigured NVIDIA targets (`D-022`); execution target binding aligned with ADR-0005 (`LOCAL`, `REMOTE`, `MCP_ENDPOINT`); discovery authority boundaries ensuring MCP/remote probing does not silently mutate capability identities; and proposed Phase 3 interface contracts (`SkillRegistry`, `SkillResolver`, `SkillExecutor`). Updated `STATUS.md` and `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.

**Why:** `[P§15]`, `[P§23]`, `[P§29.9]`, `[P§34]` — establishes specialized procedural knowledge linking abstract capabilities to executable tools without hard-coding prompts or reimplementing vendor expertise.

**Broke:** Nothing broken. Architecture and specification contracts only; no runtime implementation code modified.

**Learned:** Explicit target requirement schemas in skill descriptors allow the resolver to detect missing hardware runtimes ahead of invocation, turning silent execution failures or invalid fallback assumptions into deterministic, transparent `KNOWN_BUT_UNAVAILABLE` states.

**Left open:** ADR-0007 specification drafted in `Proposed` status, awaiting architectural review. Q10 remains open and continues to block ADR-0009 (Dataset subsystem).
