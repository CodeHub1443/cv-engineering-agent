Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <session title> (<branch or PR>)
**Did:**       what changed, concretely
**Why:**       the reason, citing [P§n] or ADR-XXXX
**Broke:**     what went wrong, including dead ends — record these, they are the
               most valuable lines in this file
**Learned:**   what a future session should know
**Left open:** what was deliberately not done
```

## 2026-08-30 — Governance scaffold (docs bootstrap)

**Did:** Froze the project definition as `docs/PROJECT.md` (§1–§35, verbatim). Created
`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, architecture overview with the responsibility table, ADR
template, seed ADR-0001 (capability model), roadmap, rolling state files, and the
approvals / research / evaluation / data contracts.

**Why:** `[P§35]` — the canonical document must be turned into operational repository
files without losing or contradicting any of it. The `[P§__]` citation convention exists
so drift from canon is greppable rather than a matter of opinion.

**Broke:** Nothing yet — no code touched.

**Learned:** The document's own §29 principles and §34 boundary test are strong enough to
serve directly as machine-enforceable rules; they were lifted into `CLAUDE.md` rather
than paraphrased.

**Left open:** Every ADR except the seed. GitHub scaffolding. Answers to Q1–Q5 in
`OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.
