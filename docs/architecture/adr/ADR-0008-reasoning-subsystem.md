## 1. Context

In the CV Engineering Agent architecture, the system operates across distinct operational layers `[P§19]`, `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md`:

$$\text{Reasoning (ADR-0008)} \longleftrightarrow \text{Orchestration (ADR-0003)} \longleftrightarrow \text{Knowledge (ADR-0006)} \longleftrightarrow \text{Skills (ADR-0007)} \longleftrightarrow \text{Tools (ADR-0005)}$$

Reasoning is the cognitive substrate responsible for **engineering judgment, task framing, problem decomposition, strategy selection, and diagnostic analysis** `[P§4]`, `[P§5]`. Computer vision engineering is fundamentally empirical and constrained:
1. **Problem Characterization (`[P§6]`, `[P§29.1]`):** Objectives must be formally framed against latency, throughput, compute budget, and edge deployment constraints before any architecture is selected.
2. **Baseline Formulation (`[P§4]`, `[P§29.2]`):** Engineering progress requires a measurable baseline before speculative exploration or fine-tuning begins.
3. **Hardware-Aware Selection (`[P§29.4]`):** Architecture and quantization choices must explicitly account for target hardware capabilities (e.g. Jetson Orin vs. server GPU vs. CPU).
4. **Diagnostic Analysis (`[P§4]`, `[P§29.3]`):** Post-experiment analysis must interpret quantitative metrics (loss curves, mAP, FPS, memory footprint) against hypotheses to determine next steps.

Without an explicit Reasoning architecture, LLM-based systems collapse into classic anti-patterns `[P§31]`:
- **The "Prompt Pile" Failure:** Ad-hoc monolithic prompts mix domain reasoning, tool calling, JSON parsing, and state flow into unmaintainable prompt heaps.
- **Layer Leakage (`[P§19]`, `[P§34]`):** Reasoning nodes attempt to manage workflow checkpointing (ADR-0003), call subprocesses/tools directly (ADR-0005), or perform raw vector retrieval (ADR-0006).
- **The Conversational Chatbot Fallacy:** Producing unstructured conversational prose rather than typed, structured engineering decisions.
- **Unbounded Provider Coupling (`[P§20]`):** Direct imports of proprietary provider SDKs (`openai`, `anthropic`) inside reasoning logic.

## 2. Responsibility (`[P§34]`)

- **This owns:**
  - The architectural contracts, taxonomy, and schemas for **Reasoning Nodes** (problem framing, baseline selection, experiment diagnosis, strategy formulation).
  - The transformation of empirical context (user requirements, hardware constraints, experiment history, retrieved evidence) into structured engineering decisions.
  - The formulation of **Capability Intent**: expressing *what* capability (`CapabilityId` per ADR-0001) is needed next, without executing tools, resolving skills, or validating registry authority.
  - The prompt construction standards, system persona definitions, and schema enforcement mechanisms.
  - The strict boundary governing consumption of LLM capabilities exclusively through the LLM Gateway (`ADR-0002`).
  - Grounding validation via a dedicated reasoning-layer validator (`GroundingValidator`) against supplied read-only evidence chunks (`ADR-0006`).
  - The diagnostic failure and uncertainty taxonomy (identifying metric saturation, overfitting, latency bottlenecks, and ambiguous goals).
  - The identification of actions requiring human approval recommendations per `docs/APPROVALS.md` `[P§24]`.
- **This does NOT own:**
  - Workflow graph lifecycle, state transitions, checkpointing, or pause/resume loops → Orchestration (ADR-0003) `[P§21]`;
  - High-volume experiment logging, SQLite ledger schema, or Git-tracked memory persistence → Project Memory & Ledger (ADR-0004) `[P§25]`;
  - Tool execution, subprocess dispatch, transport protocols, or MCP communication → Tools & MCP Boundary (ADR-0005) `[P§22]`;
  - Document indexing, hybrid search, RAG retrieval, or freshness decay → Knowledge Subsystem (ADR-0006) `[P§16]`–`[P§19]`;
  - Procedural recipes, command-line flags, vendor adapters, or skill resolution → Skills Architecture (ADR-0007) `[P§15]`, `[P§23]`;
  - LLM provider client SDKs, API keys, retry/fallback logic, or cost tracking → LLM Gateway (ADR-0002) `[P§20]`;
  - Authoritative capability registration, capability validation, or taxonomy definition → Capability Model (ADR-0001) `[P§23]`;
  - Authoritative approval policy evaluation, threshold verification, or token validation → Orchestration & Approvals (ADR-0003, `docs/APPROVALS.md`) `[P§24]`.
- **Why this responsibility does not belong elsewhere:**
  A workflow graph (ADR-0003) routes state transitions but cannot reason about computer vision trade-offs. Tools (ADR-0005) and skills (ADR-0007) execute discrete procedures but cannot synthesize diagnostic hypotheses. Knowledge (ADR-0006) provides passive evidence but does not exercise judgment. Isolating Reasoning into modular nodes preserves auditability, enables unit testing of decision logic with mocked LLM responses, and eliminates layer leakage.

## 3. Decision

We establish a **Structured Reasoning Subsystem Architecture** based on stateless, provider-agnostic reasoning components, typed decision contracts, provider-isolated LLM Gateway consumption, and grounded evidence consumption.

### 3.1. Architectural Model & Component Operation

Reasoning operates as stateless, provider-agnostic reasoning components embedded within Orchestration graph workflows (ADR-0003). While invoking `LLMGateway.complete()` executes an external model call with operational side effects (network I/O, token usage, non-zero temperature sampling), reasoning components maintain zero hidden in-process state between invocations:

```

### 3.2. Core Reasoning Node Taxonomy

Reasoning is divided into specialized, decoupled node types matching the engineering lifecycle `[P§4]`:

1. **Problem Framing Node (`[P§6]`, `[P§29.1]`):**
   - *Input:* Raw user intent, environment description, edge target specifications.
   - *Function:* Formulates structured problem characterization; verifies constraint completeness (latency budget, target hardware, dataset availability).
   - *Output:* Typed `ProblemCharacterization`.
2. **Baseline Selection Node (`[P§4]`, `[P§29.2]`):**
   - *Input:* `ProblemCharacterization`, project memory history.
   - *Function:* Formulates reference baseline specification (architecture, weights, resolution, evaluation protocol).
   - *Output:* Typed `BaselineSpec`. Capability intent for executing or evaluating the baseline is emitted as a distinct decision where appropriate.
3. **Experiment Diagnosis Node (`[P§4]`, `[P§29.3]`):**
   - *Input:* Current experiment metrics (`RunRecord` from ADR-0004), baseline metrics, target constraints.
   - *Function:* Compares outcome against hypothesis; classifies empirical behavior (e.g. `OVERFITTING`, `LATENCY_BOTTLENECK`, `SATURATION`, `METRIC_IMPROVED`).
   - *Output:* Typed `DiagnosticRecord`.
4. **Strategy Formulation Node (`[P§5]`, `[P§29.4]`):**
   - *Input:* `DiagnosticRecord`, grounded knowledge evidence (`ADR-0006`), hardware profile.
   - *Function:* Selects next engineering hypothesis and expresses capability intent (`CapabilityId`).
   - *Output:* Typed `StrategyDecision` with requested `CapabilityId` and parameter constraints.

### 3.3. Layer Boundary Invariants

1. **The LLM Gateway Invariant (`[P§20]`, ADR-0002):**
   - Reasoning nodes MUST NOT import provider SDKs (`openai`, `anthropic`, `google.generativeai`).
   - All language model interactions occur strictly through `LLMGateway.complete()` using `CompletionRequest` and `CompletionResponse`.
   - Prompt templates are provider-agnostic. Provider-specific formatting or routing is strictly encapsulated inside ADR-0002.
2. **The Knowledge Consumption & Grounding Invariant (`[P§16]`, `[P§19]`, ADR-0006):**
   - Reasoning nodes consume retrieved knowledge passively as read-only evidence chunks.
   - External evidence MUST be wrapped in `<knowledge_citation>` isolation blocks with provenance metadata preserved.
   - Reasoning nodes own interpretation and judgment; they never execute retrieval, indexing, or freshness filtering directly.
   - **Grounding Verification Boundary:** Grounding validation is performed by a dedicated `GroundingValidator` within the Reasoning subsystem. The validator evaluates the emitted decision against the active `<knowledge_citation>` blocks provided in the input context; it validates adherence to supplied evidence (detecting evidence contradiction or unsupported speculative inference) and does NOT perform retrieval, freshness ranking, or become a knowledge authority (which remains strictly owned by ADR-0006).
3. **The Capability Intent & Downstream Authority Invariant (`[P§23]`, ADR-0001, ADR-0007):**
   - Reasoning nodes express operational needs solely as **Capability Intent** (`CapabilityId`).
   - **Downstream Authority Separation:** Reasoning does NOT validate whether a `CapabilityId` is registered or executable. Authority flow is:
     $$\text{Reasoning} \longrightarrow \text{Capability Intent} \longrightarrow \text{ADR-0007 SkillResolver} \longrightarrow \text{ADR-0001 Capability Authority} \longrightarrow \text{SkillId} \longrightarrow \text{ToolId}$$
   - If reasoning emits an invalid or unrecognized `CapabilityId`, authoritative rejection happens downstream: **ADR-0007 SkillResolver resolves the intent against the authoritative capability registry defined by ADR-0001**, rejecting unresolvable intents (`UNKNOWN_CAPABILITY`), not inside the reasoning node.
   - Reasoning nodes MUST NOT generate tool invocations, CLI arguments, or shell commands directly.
4. **The Approval Recommendation Invariant (`[P§24]`, `docs/APPROVALS.md`):**
   - When a reasoning node assesses that a proposed strategy involves high risk, destruction, or high expense (e.g. lengthy remote training, destructive data mutation, unverified edge deployment), it sets `recommends_approval = True` and provides an `approval_recommendation_reason`.
   - Reasoning does NOT evaluate or enforce approval policy. Authoritative gate evaluation, approval ticket verification, and interrupt lifecycles remain strictly owned by Orchestration (`ADR-0003`) and `docs/APPROVALS.md`.

### 3.4. Structured Output, Schema Recovery, and Mandatory Auditability

Reasoning components reject free-form conversational prose. The Reasoning subsystem standardizes on **Pydantic v2 (`pydantic.BaseModel`)** to enforce strict runtime schema generation, deserialization, and output validation for all LLM interactions.

- **Schema Recovery Boundary:** If an LLM response fails schema validation, the reasoning node executes a localized prompt repair loop (maximum 2 retries) requesting the model reformat the output to conform to schema. This recovery mechanism operates strictly at the reasoning output parsing layer; it is completely independent of and does NOT override or interfere with the transport retries, rate-limit backoffs, or provider fallback sequences governed by the LLM Gateway (`ADR-0002`).
- **Mandatory Auditability Envelope:** Every decision produced by the Reasoning subsystem is wrapped in a mandatory `DecisionPayload[T]` envelope containing a complete, traceable `DecisionAuditRecord` capturing:
  1. `decision_id`: Unique decision identifier (e.g. UUIDv4 or run-scoped monotonic identifier).
  2. `node_name`: Name of the reasoning component.
  3. `model_id`: Model identifier returned by LLM Gateway (`ADR-0002`).
  4. `context_ref`: Cryptographic hash or identifier of the input context.
  5. `evidence_citation_uris`: Tuple of cited source URIs from `<knowledge_citation>` blocks (matching ADR-0006 `source_uri`).
  6. `assumptions_and_uncertainties`: Explicit tuple of assumptions and unverified risks.
  7. `output_schema_version`: Version string of the emitted schema.
  8. `timestamp_utc`: ISO-8601 timestamp correlated with the active run.

## 5. Normalized Failure & Escalation Taxonomy

The Reasoning subsystem defines structured exception and uncertainty types:

### A. Formulation & Contract Failures
1. **`AMBIGUOUS_OBJECTIVE`:** The user task cannot be characterized into measurable constraints (`[P§6]`).
2. **`INSUFFICIENT_FEASIBILITY_EVIDENCE`:** Reasoning flags that available empirical evidence and reference architectures indicate the stated latency/throughput/accuracy trade-off is unlikely to be met on the target hardware. Reasoning does NOT possess authority to declare physical impossibility; it identifies an evidence gap or apparent infeasibility requiring human clarification or experimental investigation.
3. **`MISSING_BASELINE`:** An optimization or fine-tuning strategy was requested before a reference baseline was established (`[P§29.2]`).

### B. Execution, Parsing & Evidence Failures
4. **`SCHEMA_PARSING_FAILED`:** The LLM failed to return valid JSON conforming to the node's schema after localized recovery retries.
5. **`UNGROUNDED_REASONING`:** The generated decision violates evidence grounding. Specifically distinguished into:
   - **Evidence Contradiction:** Reasoning asserts factual or capability claims that directly contradict citations provided in `<knowledge_citation>` blocks.
   - **Unsupported Speculative Inference:** Reasoning asserts empirical hardware performance numbers, domain constraints, or architectural capabilities without supporting evidence citations or empirical experiment records.
6. **`UNRESOLVABLE_CAPABILITY_INTENT`:** Downstream resolution (`ADR-0007 SkillResolver`) rejects the `CapabilityId` emitted by Reasoning because it is unrecognized by the authoritative ADR-0001 registry or lacks a satisfying skill.

## 6. Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Why Not Chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Monolithic ReAct / Chatbot Loop** | Simple to implement initially; common in naive agents. | Degrades into "prompt piles" `[P§31]`; unpredictable state transitions; mixes tools with reasoning `[P§19]`. | Violates `[P§19]`, `[P§31]`, `[P§34]`. |
| **Vendor-Specific Framework (e.g. LangChain / CrewAI agents)** | Pre-built agents and prompt libraries. | Heavy dependencies; provider leaks; poor determinism; violates architecture neutrality `[P§19]`. | Violates `[P§20]`, `[P§34]`. |
| **Hard-Coded Heuristics (Rule-Based Expert System)** | 100% deterministic; zero LLM inference cost. | Brittle; fails on novel CV domains or unstructured user specifications. | Fails `[P§5]` (requires adaptive engineering judgment). |
| **Merge Reasoning into Orchestration Nodes** | Fewer files; direct graph execution. | Tight coupling between workflow graphs and prompt logic; impossible to unit-test reasoning without running graph engines. | Violates `[P§19]`, `[P§34]`. |

## 7. Consequences

### Positive
- **Architectural Purity (`[P§19]`, `[P§34]`):** Reasoning owns pure judgment; orchestration owns workflow; tools own execution; knowledge owns facts.
- **Provider Agnostic (`[P§20]`):** Zero provider lock-in; reasoning functions identically across Anthropic, OpenAI, or local Ollama models.
- **Grounded & Disciplined (`[P§29.1]`–`[P§29.4]`):** Enforces problem-first, baseline-first, and hardware-aware engineering principles.
- **Auditability:** Every decision produces a mandatory `DecisionAuditRecord` with explicit rationale, schema version, and citation URIs.

### Negative / Costs
- **Indirection Overhead:** Structured prompts and schema parsing add serialization latency compared to unstructured streaming.
- **Schema Rigidity:** Changing decision structures requires versioned Pydantic models.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

1. **Layer Separation Preserved:** Reasoning components operate as stateless, provider-agnostic decision components without owning workflow transitions (ADR-0003), tool execution (ADR-0005), or retrieval (ADR-0006) `[P§19]`.
2. **Provider Agnostic LLM Access:** Reasoning components interface with LLMs exclusively via `LLMGateway` (ADR-0002); no direct provider SDK imports exist in reasoning modules `[P§20]`.
3. **Capability Intent Decoupled from Authority:** Reasoning expresses action intent by emitting `CapabilityId`s; **ADR-0007 SkillResolver resolves the intent against the authoritative capability registry defined by ADR-0001** `[P§23]`.
4. **Structured Decision Outputs via Pydantic:** All reasoning nodes output typed, schema-validated structures via Pydantic v2 `BaseModel`; unstructured free text is disallowed.
5. **Baseline-First Enforcement:** Strategy selection nodes mandate a valid baseline measurement before proposing optimizations or fine-tuning runs `[P§29.2]`.
6. **Hardware-Aware Framing:** Problem characterization and strategy selection schemas explicitly model target hardware constraints and compute budgets `[P§29.4]`.
7. **Grounded Evidence Consumption & Verification:** Retrieved external facts are consumed as read-only `<knowledge_citation>` blocks; evidence contradiction and unsupported speculative inference are validated by `GroundingValidator`.
8. **Approval Preconditions Recommended, Not Enforced:** Reasoning nodes recommend approval (`recommends_approval = True`) and provide rationale; authoritative policy evaluation and gate enforcement remain owned by ADR-0003 and `docs/APPROVALS.md` `[P§24]`.
9. **Mandatory Auditability:** All decisions preserve comprehensive audit records (`decision_id`, `node_name`, `model_id`, `context_ref`, citation URIs, schema version, and timestamp).
10. **Zero Runtime Implementation in Phase 1:** Specification defines interface contracts and architectural boundaries without introducing speculative runtime implementation code.
